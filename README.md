HOW TO START THE SERVER
========================================================================================
1. Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/Wishoje/e-resonate.git
2. Navigate to the newly create folder
3. Install all dependencies - "npm install"
4. Start the server - "npm start"
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/

Notes:
- Fonts are not the same as on the mocks.
- Maximum ViewPort is set to 1440px for the form because of the width of the backround image 
(not sure if that is how we want for larger screens than 1440px) - please let me know if that needs to be fixed.
