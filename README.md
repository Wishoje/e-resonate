HOW TO START THE SERVER
========================================================================================
1. Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/Wishoje/e-resonate.git
2. Navigate to the newly create folder example
3. Install all dependencies - "npm install"
4. Start the server - "npm start"

Notes:
- Fonts are not the same as on the mocks since it was hard to find them.
- Maximum ViewPort is set to 1440px but we might want to expand that for larger screens and also add tablet screens as well.
